# STAR

'tell me about a time you performed well under pressure?'

## situation
One time, at my last job, my coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished and without a manager.

## task
My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks.

## action
I requested and was granted a reduction in my weekly goals, allotting me more time to attack the special project. As far as my weekly goals, I was able to delegate them out evenly to some of my teammates.

## result
With the reduction in my daily goals, I was able to dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise.

# What extra value does Devops bring to an agile team?
The first way	- System - Thinking	emphasises the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department, this can be as large as a division or as small as an individual contributor.

The second way - Amplify - Feedback Loops	creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.

The third way	- Culture - of Continual Experimentation and Learning	creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.

# Why do i need to pay you? What value do you bring?
Teams that adopt DevOps culture, practices and tolls become high-performing, building better products faster for greatest customer satisfaction. this improved collaboration and productivity is also integral to achieve business goals like these:

- Accelerating time to market
- Adaption to the market and competition
- Maintaining system stability and reliability
- Improving the mean time to recovery
